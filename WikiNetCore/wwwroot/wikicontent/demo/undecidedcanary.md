# Why we keep this Canary

This canary is an example of a canary that flips between happy and dead. Yeah, so a zombie canary, I guess.

# What to do about it

## First reponse

Run? I don't know, what's a good response when faced with a zombie canary - this is new territory for both of us.

## If that doesn't work

Join the zombie canary horde. Maybe you get the gift of undead flight.
